# Async Functions in Python

In Python, async functions are used to write asynchronous code that can run concurrently with other tasks. They allow you to perform non-blocking operations, such as making API calls or reading from a file, without blocking the execution of the rest of your program.

## How to Define an Async Function

To define an async function in Python, you need to use the `async` keyword before the `def` keyword. Here's an example:

```python
async def my_async_function():
    # Code goes here
```

## How to Call an Async Function

To call an async function, you need to use the `await` keyword before the function call. This tells Python to wait for the function to complete before moving on to the next line of code. Here's an example:

```python
async def my_async_function():
    # Code goes here

async def main():
    await my_async_function()

# Call the main function to start the async code execution
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Handling Exceptions in Async Functions

When working with async functions, it's important to handle exceptions properly. You can use the `try` and `except` keywords to catch and handle exceptions within an async function. Here's an example:

```python
async def my_async_function():
    try:
        # Code goes here
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle the exception
```

## Conclusion

Async functions in Python provide a powerful way to write asynchronous code and improve the performance of your programs. By using async functions, you can perform multiple tasks concurrently and avoid blocking the execution of your program.
