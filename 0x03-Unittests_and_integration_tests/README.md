# Unittest

Python unittest is a built-in testing framework that allows you to write and run unit tests for your Python code. It provides a set of tools and assertions to help you verify that your code behaves as expected. With unittest, you can define test cases, organize them into test suites, and run them to ensure the correctness of your code. By writing tests, you can catch bugs early, improve code quality, and make your code more robust. To get started with unittest, you can import the `unittest` module and create test classes that inherit from `unittest.TestCase`. Within these test classes, you can define test methods that start with the word `test_`. Inside these test methods, you can use various assertions provided by the `TestCase` class to check if the actual output matches the expected output. To run the tests, you can use the `unittest.main()` function or run the tests from the command line using the `python -m unittest` command. By following the principles of test-driven development and writing comprehensive unit tests, you can ensure the reliability and maintainability of your Python code.
